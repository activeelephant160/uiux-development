# Development

### Link to Deployed Website
If you used the stencil code, this is `https://activeelephant160.github.io/uiux-development`

### Goal and Value of the Application
I really love wearing sneakers but have always wanted to compare different types, colors and prices of shoes on one platform. I created this application to do just that. I added different filters and sort functions to self-select various combinations of sneakers in order to contrast brands. I also added a price aggregator to get an idea of how much sneakers would cost when multiple are purchased from different brands. 

### Usability Principles Considered 
Controllability: The user has complete control of the webpage and filtering functions. They can choose to use it as they please. 

Design and Layout: The website is comprehensible at first site. The checkbox and radiobutton labels are intuitive to understand and the information is presented in way that can be easily correlated. 

Visibility: The functions of the website are very clear and the user understands their possibilities. The description about how the filters work provide clear direction and are self-explanatory. 

### Organization of Components
I created a SneakerCard component that holds each Card with all the appropriate information like Sneaker type (High Top or Low Top), brand (Adidas, Nike, Veja etc), color (white or any colors) etc. It creates the structure of the card and uses props to identify each property from the data.json file. The SneakerCard component is passed to App.js.
